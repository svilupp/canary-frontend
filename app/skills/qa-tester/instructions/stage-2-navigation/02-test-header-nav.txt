# Micro-Task: Header Navigation Testing

**Task ID:** `test-header-nav`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Click each header navigation link and verify it navigates correctly without errors.

---

## What to Do

1. **Start from home page:**
   - Note the current URL

2. **For EACH header navigation link:**
   - Click the link
   - Wait for page to load
   - Check: Did URL change? (or did content change for SPAs?)
   - Check: Is there an error (404, 500, blank page)?
   - Check: Did new content load?
   - Go back to home page

3. **Record results:**
   - Which links worked
   - Which links failed
   - What errors occurred

---

## Definition of Done

You've tested:
- ✅ Every header navigation link
- ✅ Each link either works (loads content) or fails (shows error)
- ✅ You returned to home page after each test
- ✅ You recorded all failures clearly

---

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalLinksTested": 5,
  "workingLinks": 5,
  "failedLinks": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "linkText": "Home",
      "worked": true,
      "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/",
      "error": null
    },

      "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/about",
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

**If any links failed:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "totalLinksTested": 5,
  "workingLinks": 4,
  "failedLinks": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "linkText": "Home",
      "worked": true,
      "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/",

- **totalLinksTested**: Count of header links tested
- **workingLinks**: Count of links that worked
- **failedLinks**: Count of links that failed
- **results**: Array of test results for each link
  - **linkText**: Text of the link clicked
  - **worked**: `true` if link worked, `false` if failed
  - **urlAfterClick**: URL after clicking (or "NO_CHANGE" for SPAs that don't change URL)

## Examples

### Example 1: All links work
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalLinksTested": 4,
  "workingLinks": 4,
  "failedLinks": 0,
  "results": [
    {"linkText": "Home", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/", "error": null},
    {"linkText": "About", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/about", "error": null},
    {"linkText": "Services", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/services", "error": null},
    {"linkText": "Contact", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/contact", "error": null}
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

### Example 2: One link broken
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "totalLinksTested": 3,
  "workingLinks": 2,
  "failedLinks": 1,
  "results": [
    {"linkText": "Home", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/", "error": null},
    {"linkText": "Products", "worked": false, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/products", "error": "404 Not Found - Page does not exist"},
    {"linkText": "About", "worked": true, "urlAfterClick": "https://example.com/about", "error": null}
  ],
  "failures": ["Products: 404 Not Found - Page does not exist"]
}
```

## Important Notes

- **What counts as "worked":** Page loads with content, no error messages
- **What counts as "failed":** 404, 500, blank page, network error, or no response
- **For SPAs (Single Page Apps):** URL might not change, but content should change
- **Return to home:** Always go back to home page between tests to ensure clean state
- **Be thorough:** Test every header link, even if it seems redundant

---

## Time Estimate
Expected completion: 30-60 seconds (depends on number of links)
