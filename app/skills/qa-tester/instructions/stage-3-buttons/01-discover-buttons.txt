# Micro-Task: Button Discovery

**Task ID:** `discover-buttons`
**Severity:** INFO
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Find all buttons and interactive elements on the page to understand what needs to be tested.

---

## What to Do

1. **Find all button elements:**
   - Look for `<button>` elements
   - Look for elements with role="button"
   - Exclude navigation links (those were tested in Stage 2)

2. **Categorize buttons by type:**
   - **Primary actions:** Submit, Save, Checkout, Buy Now, Sign Up, etc.
   - **Modal triggers:** Buttons that open popups/dialogs (e.g., "Learn More", "View Details")
   - **Toggle buttons:** Show/Hide, Expand/Collapse, Read More, etc.
   - **Disabled buttons:** Buttons that are currently disabled/inactive

3. **Note button locations:**
   - Where on the page is each button?
   - Is it always visible or do you need to scroll?

---

## Definition of Done

You've successfully cataloged:
- ✅ All buttons found on the page
- ✅ Buttons categorized by type
- ✅ Total count of each button type
- ✅ Note if there are no buttons (some pages might only have links)

---

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalButtons": 8,
  "primaryActions": ["Submit Form", "Buy Now", "Get Started"],
  "modalTriggers": ["Learn More", "View Details"],
  "toggleButtons": ["Show More", "Expand FAQ"],
  "disabledButtons": ["Subscribe (disabled)"],
  "otherButtons": [],
  "hasButtons": true
}
```

---

## Field Definitions

- **success**: Always `true` (this is just discovery, can't fail)
- **totalButtons**: Total count of all buttons found
- **primaryActions**: Array of primary action button texts
- **modalTriggers**: Array of buttons that open modals/dialogs
- **toggleButtons**: Array of toggle/expand/collapse buttons
- **disabledButtons**: Array of currently disabled button texts
- **otherButtons**: Array of other buttons that don't fit categories
- **hasButtons**: `true` if any buttons found, `false` if none
- **painPoint**: (optional) Note if anything was confusing

## Examples

### Example 1: Page with various buttons
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalButtons": 6,
  "primaryActions": ["Contact Us", "Get Quote"],
  "modalTriggers": ["Watch Video", "See Pricing"],
  "toggleButtons": ["Show Details"],
  "disabledButtons": ["Submit (disabled - form incomplete)"],
  "otherButtons": [],
  "hasButtons": true
}
```

### Example 2: Page with no buttons (only links)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalButtons": 0,
  "primaryActions": [],
  "modalTriggers": [],
  "toggleButtons": [],
  "disabledButtons": [],
  "otherButtons": [],
  "hasButtons": false
}
```

### Example 3: Simple page with one primary button
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalButtons": 1,
  "primaryActions": ["Sign Up"],
  "modalTriggers": [],
  "toggleButtons": [],
  "disabledButtons": [],
  "otherButtons": [],
  "hasButtons": true
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Buttons vs Links:**
  - Buttons perform actions (submit, open modal, toggle)
  - Links navigate to pages (tested in Stage 2)
  - Only catalog buttons here

- **Disabled buttons:**
  - Note them but don't try to click yet
  - We'll test them in task 05

- **Don't click yet:**
  - This is discovery only
  - Just catalog what exists

- **Use ariaTree:**
  - Efficiently find all button elements
  - Check role="button" attributes
