# Micro-Task: Primary Action Button Testing

**Task ID:** `test-primary-actions`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Test all primary action buttons to ensure they work correctly and don't cause errors.

---

## What to Do

1. **Identify primary action buttons:**
   - Submit, Save, Buy, Checkout, Sign Up, Get Started, Contact, etc.
   - These are the main CTAs (Call To Action) on the page
   - If none exist, return success with `hasPrimaryActions: false`

2. **For EACH primary action button:**
   - Click the button
   - Observe what happens:
     - Does it navigate to a new page?
     - Does it submit a form?
     - Does it show an error message (e.g., "Please fill required fields")?
     - Does it show a success message?
     - Does nothing happen (BUG)?
   - Record the result
   - Return to starting state if needed

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Console errors after clicking?
   - Blank page?
   - 404/500 errors?
   - JavaScript exceptions?

---

## Definition of Done

You've tested:
- ✅ Every primary action button found
- ✅ Each button's behavior recorded (what happened when clicked)
- ✅ Any errors/failures documented
- ✅ Confirmed buttons are functional (do something when clicked)

**Note:** A button showing validation errors like "Email required" is NOT a failure - that's expected behavior. Only report failure if button is completely broken (does nothing, throws error, crashes page).

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hasPrimaryActions": true,
  "totalTested": 2,
  "workingButtons": 2,
  "brokenButtons": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "buttonText": "Contact Us",
      "worked": true,
      "behavior": "Navigated to contact page at /contact",
      "error": null
    },
    {
      "buttonText": "Subscribe",
      "worked": true,
      "behavior": "Showed validation error: 'Email is required' (expected behavior)",
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

**If button is broken:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "hasPrimaryActions": true,
  "totalTested": 2,
  "workingButtons": 1,
  "brokenButtons": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "buttonText": "Submit",
      "worked": true,
      "behavior": "Form submitted successfully",
      "error": null
    },
    {
      "buttonText": "Get Started",
      "worked": false,
      "behavior": "Button clicked but nothing happened - no response",
      "error": "Button appears broken - no action on click"
    }
  ],
  "failures": ["Get Started: Button appears broken - no action on click"]
}
```

## Field Definitions

- **success**: `true` if ALL primary buttons work, `false` if ANY are broken
- **hasPrimaryActions**: `true` if page has primary action buttons
- **totalTested**: Count of primary action buttons tested
- **workingButtons**: Count of buttons that worked
- **brokenButtons**: Count of buttons that are broken
- **results**: Array of test results for each button
  - **buttonText**: Text of the button
  - **worked**: `true` if button does something, `false` if completely broken
  - **behavior**: Description of what happened when clicked
  - **error**: Error message if broken, `null` if worked
- **failures**: Array of failure descriptions
- **painPoint**: (optional) Note if anything was confusing

## Examples

### Example 1: All buttons work
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hasPrimaryActions": true,
  "totalTested": 3,
  "workingButtons": 3,
  "brokenButtons": 0,
  "results": [
    {"buttonText": "Buy Now", "worked": true, "behavior": "Navigated to checkout page", "error": null},
    {"buttonText": "Sign Up", "worked": true, "behavior": "Showed validation: 'Email required' (expected)", "error": null},
    {"buttonText": "Contact", "worked": true, "behavior": "Opened contact modal dialog", "error": null}
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

### Example 2: No primary actions on page
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hasPrimaryActions": false,
  "totalTested": 0,
  "workingButtons": 0,
  "brokenButtons": 0,
  "results": [],
  "failures": []
}
```

### Example 3: One broken button
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "hasPrimaryActions": true,
  "totalTested": 2,
  "workingButtons": 1,
  "brokenButtons": 1,
  "results": [
    {"buttonText": "Save", "worked": true, "behavior": "Saved data and showed success message", "error": null},
    {"buttonText": "Delete", "worked": false, "behavior": "Console error: TypeError - function undefined", "error": "JavaScript error on click"}
  ],
  "failures": ["Delete: JavaScript error on click"]
}
```

## Important Notes

- **What counts as "working":**
  - Button does SOMETHING when clicked
  - Navigates, submits, shows message, opens modal
  - Even validation errors like "Email required" count as working

- **What counts as "broken":**
  - Button does NOTHING when clicked (no response)
  - JavaScript error/exception thrown
  - Page crashes or freezes
  - 500 server error

- **Don't worry about correctness:**
  - We're testing if buttons WORK, not if they do the RIGHT thing
  - If "Buy Now" opens the wrong page, that's still "working" for this test

- **Primary buttons are CRITICAL:**
  - These are the main user actions
  - If these don't work, the site is broken

## Time Estimate
Expected completion: 30-60 seconds (depends on number of buttons)
