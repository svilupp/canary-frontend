# Micro-Task: Mobile Viewport Testing

**Task ID:** `test-mobile-viewport`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Verify the website works correctly on mobile devices by testing at mobile viewport size.

---

## What to Do

1. **Set viewport to mobile size:**
   - Resize browser to 375x667 pixels (iPhone SE size)
   - This is a common small mobile screen
   - Refresh the page

2. **Check if content is visible:**
   - Can you see the main content without horizontal scrolling?
   - Is text readable (not too small)?
   - Are images scaled appropriately (not cut off)?

3. **Check layout issues:**
   - Is content stacked vertically (not side-by-side)?
   - Are buttons/links large enough to tap (not tiny)?
   - Is there horizontal overflow (content wider than screen)?

4. **Test basic interaction:**
   - Try scrolling - does it work smoothly?
   - Try clicking a button - is it tappable?

---

## Definition of Done

You've verified:
- ✅ Page loaded at mobile viewport (375x667)
- ✅ Content is visible without horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Text is readable
- ✅ Layout adapts to narrow screen
- ✅ No critical visual issues

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "viewportSize": "375x667",
  "contentVisible": true,
  "textReadable": true,
  "noHorizontalScroll": true,
  "layoutAdapts": true,
  "buttonsUsable": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

**If issues found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "375x667",
  "contentVisible": true,
  "textReadable": false,
  "noHorizontalScroll": false,
  "layoutAdapts": true,
  "buttonsUsable": true,
  "issues": [
    "Text is too small to read comfortably",
    "Horizontal scrolling required to see full content"
  ]
}
```

## Field Definitions

- **success**: `true` if site works well on mobile, `false` if critical issues
- **viewportSize**: Confirm viewport size tested (should be "375x667")
- **contentVisible**: `true` if main content is visible
- **textReadable**: `true` if text is large enough to read
- **noHorizontalScroll**: `true` if no horizontal scrolling needed
- **layoutAdapts**: `true` if layout changed for mobile (stacked, not side-by-side)
- **buttonsUsable**: `true` if buttons are large enough to tap
- **issues**: Array of specific problems found (empty if none)
- **painPoint**: (optional) Note if anything was confusing

## Examples

### Example 1: Mobile works perfectly
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "viewportSize": "375x667",
  "contentVisible": true,
  "textReadable": true,
  "noHorizontalScroll": true,
  "layoutAdapts": true,
  "buttonsUsable": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

### Example 2: Horizontal scrolling required (bad)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "375x667",
  "contentVisible": true,
  "textReadable": true,
  "noHorizontalScroll": false,
  "layoutAdapts": false,
  "buttonsUsable": true,
  "issues": ["Desktop layout showing on mobile - requires horizontal scrolling", "Layout not responsive"]
}
```

### Example 3: Text too small
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "375x667",
  "contentVisible": true,
  "textReadable": false,
  "noHorizontalScroll": true,
  "layoutAdapts": true,
  "buttonsUsable": false,
  "issues": ["Text size is too small - appears to be 8px or less", "Buttons are too small to tap accurately"]
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Why 375x667:**
  - iPhone SE size - one of the smallest common phones
  - If it works here, it likely works on all mobile devices

- **What counts as "works well":**
  - All content visible without horizontal scrolling
  - Text is readable (minimum ~14-16px font size)
  - Buttons are tappable (minimum 44x44px)
  - Layout stacks vertically for narrow screen

- **What counts as "broken":**
  - Horizontal scrolling required (desktop layout on mobile)
  - Text too small to read
  - Buttons too small to tap
  - Content cut off or hidden

- **Mobile is critical:**
  - 50-70% of web traffic is mobile
  - Site must work on mobile devices
