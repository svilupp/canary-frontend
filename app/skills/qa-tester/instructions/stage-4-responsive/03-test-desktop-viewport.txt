# Micro-Task: Desktop Viewport Testing

**Task ID:** `test-desktop-viewport`
**Severity:** LOW
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Verify the website works correctly on large desktop screens.

---

## What to Do

1. **Set viewport to large desktop size:**
   - Resize browser to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD)
   - This is a common large monitor size
   - Refresh the page

2. **Check layout:**
   - Does content use the available width well?
   - Is there a max-width (content centered) or full-width layout?
   - Is content too stretched or too narrow?

3. **Check for issues:**
   - Any extremely long text lines (hard to read)?
   - Any images stretched beyond their size?
   - Any weird spacing or layout issues?

---

## Definition of Done

You've verified:
- ✅ Page loaded at desktop viewport (1920x1080)
- ✅ Layout looks good on wide screen
- ✅ Content is not overly stretched
- ✅ Text lines aren't too long
- ✅ No critical visual issues

---

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "viewportSize": "1920x1080",
  "layoutUsesSpaceWell": true,
  "textLinesReadable": true,
  "imagesNotStretched": true,
  "noLayoutIssues": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

**If issues found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "1920x1080",
  "layoutUsesSpaceWell": false,
  "textLinesReadable": false,
  "imagesNotStretched": true,
  "noLayoutIssues": true,
  "issues": ["Text lines stretch full width - too long to read comfortably (>100 characters per line)"]
}
```

---

## Field Definitions

- **success**: `true` if site works well on large desktop, `false` if critical issues
- **viewportSize**: Confirm viewport size tested (should be "1920x1080")
- **layoutUsesSpaceWell**: `true` if layout looks good (not too stretched or cramped)
- **textLinesReadable**: `true` if text lines aren't too long (ideally 50-80 characters max)
- **imagesNotStretched**: `true` if images scale properly (not pixelated/stretched)
- **noLayoutIssues**: `true` if no weird spacing or positioning issues
- **issues**: Array of specific problems found (empty if none)
- **painPoint**: (optional) Note if anything was confusing

## Examples

### Example 1: Desktop works perfectly
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "viewportSize": "1920x1080",
  "layoutUsesSpaceWell": true,
  "textLinesReadable": true,
  "imagesNotStretched": true,
  "noLayoutIssues": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

### Example 2: Text lines too long
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "1920x1080",
  "layoutUsesSpaceWell": false,
  "textLinesReadable": false,
  "imagesNotStretched": true,
  "noLayoutIssues": true,
  "issues": ["Text stretches full width of screen - lines are too long to read comfortably"]
}
```

### Example 3: Images stretched
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "viewportSize": "1920x1080",
  "layoutUsesSpaceWell": true,
  "textLinesReadable": true,
  "imagesNotStretched": false,
  "noLayoutIssues": true,
  "issues": ["Hero image is stretched and pixelated at full width"]
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Why 1920x1080:**
  - Full HD - very common large monitor size
  - Tests how site handles wide screens

- **What counts as "works well":**
  - Content uses space appropriately (centered or full-width both OK)
  - Text lines aren't too long (max ~80 characters per line)
  - Images scale properly
  - Layout looks intentional

- **What counts as "broken":**
  - Text lines extremely long (100+ characters) - hard to read
  - Images stretched and pixelated
  - Layout looks broken or accidental
  - Huge amounts of wasted whitespace

- **Common patterns:**
  - **Centered max-width:** Content has max-width (e.g., 1200px) and is centered
  - **Full-width:** Content stretches across entire screen
  - **Multi-column:** Content in multiple columns to use width

- **Desktop is lower priority:**
  - Most sites are designed for desktop first
  - Issues here are usually minor
