# Micro-Task: Tablet Viewport Testing

**Task ID:** `test-tablet-viewport`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Verify the website works correctly on tablet devices at medium screen sizes.

---

## What to Do

1. **Set viewport to tablet size:**
   - Resize browser to 768x1024 pixels (iPad size)
   - This is a common tablet screen size
   - Refresh the page

2. **Check layout:**
   - Does layout look appropriate for medium screen?
   - Is content spaced well (not too cramped, not too sparse)?
   - Are multi-column layouts working (if present)?

3. **Check for issues:**
   - Any weird spacing or overlapping content?
   - Any elements cut off or hidden?
   - Does it look like mobile layout or desktop layout?

---

- ✅ Page loaded at tablet viewport (768x1024)
- ✅ Layout looks appropriate for medium screen
- ✅ Content is well-spaced and readable
- ✅ No overlapping or cut-off content

## Important Notes

- **Why 768x1024:**
  - Standard iPad size (portrait)
  - Common tablet breakpoint in responsive design

- **What counts as "works well":**
  - Layout uses available space appropriately
  - Could be mobile-like (stacked) or desktop-like (multi-column)
  - No overlapping content
  - No awkward spacing

- **What counts as "broken":**
  - Content overlapping
  - Layout broken (elements in wrong positions)
  - Stuck in mobile layout with huge white space
  - Stuck in desktop layout with cramped content

- **Tablet is medium priority:**
  - Less critical than mobile or desktop
  - But still 10-20% of traffic on some sites
