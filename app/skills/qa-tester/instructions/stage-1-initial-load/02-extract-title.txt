# Micro-Task: Page Title Extraction

**Task ID:** `extract-title`
**Severity:** INFO
**Terminates on Failure:** NO

---

## Objective
Extract the page title from the browser tab and verify it's appropriate (not an error message).

---

## What to Do

1. Look at the browser tab/title bar
2. Read the exact text shown as the page title
3. Check if the title makes sense for this application
4. Verify it's not an error message like "Error" or "Page Not Found"

---

## Return Format

**IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RETURN ONLY VALID JSON. DO NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pageTitle": "Exact title text from browser tab",
  "isErrorTitle": false,
  "notes": "Brief observation about the title",
  "painPoint": "Optional: 1-sentence note if task was confusing"
}
```

---

## Field Definitions

- **success**: `true` if title extracted successfully, `false` if couldn't find title
- **pageTitle**: Exact text from the browser tab (string)
- **isErrorTitle**: `true` if title indicates error (like "Error", "404"), `false` otherwise
- **notes**: Your observation (e.g., "Title is descriptive and professional")

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Good Title
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pageTitle": "Buy Time - Longevity Tech",
  "isErrorTitle": false,
  "notes": "Title is clear and describes the application purpose"
}
```

### Example 2: Error Title
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pageTitle": "Error 404 - Page Not Found",
  "isErrorTitle": true,
  "notes": "Title indicates an error page",
  "painPoint": "Unclear what counts as an error title besides 404"
}
```

### Example 3: Generic Title
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pageTitle": "Home",
  "isErrorTitle": false,
  "notes": "Title is very generic, could be more descriptive"
}
```

---

## Important Notes

- This is an INFO check - failure won't stop subsequent tests
- Be precise - copy the exact title text
- Don't judge if the title is "good" or "bad", just report what it is
- Add painPoint if instructions were confusing (optional, 1 sentence max)
- **MUST RETURN ONLY JSON** - No explanatory text before or after

Expected completion: 3-5 seconds
