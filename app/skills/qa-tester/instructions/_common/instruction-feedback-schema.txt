## Instruction Feedback

Always include this in your response to help improve instructions:

```json
{
  "instructionFeedback": {
    "clarity": "CLEAR" | "UNCLEAR" | "AMBIGUOUS",
    "completeness": "COMPLETE" | "MISSING_DETAILS" | "TOO_VERBOSE",
    "issues": [
      {
        "type": "UNCLEAR_INSTRUCTION" | "MISSING_STEP" | "WRONG_EXAMPLE" | "OUTDATED" | "INCORRECT",
        "location": "section name or line",
        "description": "what was wrong",
        "suggestion": "how to fix it"
      }
    ],
    "improvements": [
      {
        "type": "ADD_CHECK" | "CLARIFY_STEP" | "ADD_EXAMPLE" | "SIMPLIFY" | "REORGANIZE",
        "description": "what could be better",
        "suggestedChange": "specific change to make"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- **clarity**: Were instructions clear?
- **completeness**: Right amount of detail?
- **issues**: Problems you encountered (array)
- **improvements**: Suggestions for next version (array)

**Be honest** - if instructions were unclear, confusing, or missing steps, report it. This helps improve the system.
